  Our font sizes are based 1.125 multiplier scale with a base size of 18px for 1 rem.
  The values have been rounded to give whole pixel values. Using sizes from this type scale
  will create visual, as well as hierarchical consistency, throughout our services. Line-heights
  should always be a multiple of 4, this will ensure the copy aligns to the 8px baseline
  grid while allowing more flexibility in setting type than multiples of 8.
